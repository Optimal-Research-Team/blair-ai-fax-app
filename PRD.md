# Blair AI Fax Sorter
## Proposal for KMH Cardiology Clinics

**Date:** February 2026
**Prepared by:** Blair AI

## 1. Introduction

### About Blair AI

Blair AI is an Agentic AI platform purpose-built for automating clinical operations in cardiology. Our solutions span referral management, AI-powered fax processing, and intelligent voice intakes. Blair AI is currently deployed with KMH Cardiology—one of the largest cardiovascular clinics in the country—where it has automated patient intakes and significantly reduced the administrative burden on clinical staff.

### Understanding KMH's Needs

KMH Cardiology Clinics processes thousands of incoming faxes monthly—referrals, ECGs, lab results, and clinical correspondence. Manual triage consumes staff time, introduces delays, and risks lost documents. Your RFP outlines clear requirements for reliable classification, efficient workflows, and seamless integration with your existing systems.

Of all document types, **referrals represent the most complex workflow challenge**. Unlike simple document filing, referrals require completeness tracking (ensuring all required clinical documents are present), multi-channel follow-up communications to obtain missing information, SLA enforcement to prevent urgent cases from slipping through, and seamless handoff to cardiologists for review. A robust referral management system is the backbone of efficient clinic operations—and it's where Blair delivers the most value.

### Our Solution: Blair

Blair is an AI-powered fax sorting and referral management system purpose-built for cardiology clinics. Blair reduces manual triage time by **90%** while ensuring **100% referral completeness** before physician review. With intelligent document classification, real-time SLA tracking, and automated follow-up communications, Blair transforms your fax inbox from a bottleneck into a streamlined workflow.

## 2. RFP Requirements Compliance

### 2.1 Reliable End-to-End Fax Indexing with Classification

Blair's AI processing engine performs OCR text extraction and document type detection on every incoming fax. The system supports multiple document types common to cardiology clinics—referrals, ECGs, bloodwork, echocardiograms, consult notes—and displays confidence scores so staff know which items need manual verification. Handwritten documents are processed through specialized OCR models, with low-confidence extractions automatically flagged for human review.

📄 [See PRD Section 4.1: Master Fax Processing Flow](https://github.com/Optimal-Research-Team/blair/blob/main/docs/BLAIR_PRD.md#41-master-fax-processing-flow)

---

### 2.2 Document Splitting by Patient and Category

Multi-patient faxes are detected automatically and flagged for splitting. The Split Tool provides a visual page strip interface where clerks click between pages to create segment markers. Each segment becomes a separate fax record with its own patient assignment, ensuring documents are never misfiled when multiple referrals arrive on a single fax.

📄 [See PRD Section 4.3: Document Splitting Flow](https://github.com/Optimal-Research-Team/blair/blob/main/docs/BLAIR_PRD.md#43-document-splitting-flow)

---

### 2.3 Automatic Document Classification and Filing

Documents are automatically classified into categories (Referral, ECG, Lab Results, etc.) and filed to appropriate folders based on configurable confidence thresholds. The Auto-File Settings page allows administrators to set per-document-type thresholds, ensuring conservative handling of clinical documents while automating administrative paperwork.

📄 [See PRD Section 5.8.1: Auto-File Settings](https://github.com/Optimal-Research-Team/blair/blob/main/docs/BLAIR_PRD.md#581-auto-file-settings-settingsauto-file)

---

### 2.4 Searchable Interface

The Fax Inbox provides global search across patient name, referring physician, document type, and fax number. Filter buttons enable quick toggling between urgent items, those needing review, and items by status. Advanced filters support date ranges, fax line selection, and completeness status for comprehensive document retrieval.

📄 [See PRD Section 5.2: Fax Inbox](https://github.com/Optimal-Research-Team/blair/blob/main/docs/BLAIR_PRD.md#52-fax-inbox-inbox)

---

### 2.5 Worklist Model with SLAs and Record Locking

The Worklist presents a unified queue where staff claim items for processing. Visual SLA timers count down with color progression (green → yellow → red) as deadlines approach. Record locking prevents concurrent edits—when one user is working on a fax, others see a lock indicator and warning banner. Priority badges (Urgent/Routine) ensure critical items surface first.

📄 [See PRD Section 5.3: Worklist](https://github.com/Optimal-Research-Team/blair/blob/main/docs/BLAIR_PRD.md#53-worklist-worklist)

---

### 2.6 AI/OCR Accuracy with Hybrid Approach

Blair employs a **tiered AI processing pipeline** that keeps costs reasonable without sacrificing accuracy. Rather than routing every document through expensive large language models, Blair uses a three-tier approach: fast OCR for initial text extraction, rule-based processing for known document templates (standard lab reports, common referral forms), and LLM processing reserved for complex or handwritten documents. This selective routing reduces LLM costs by up to 70% while maintaining high accuracy.

Confidence scores are displayed for all AI detections, and low-confidence items are automatically flagged for manual review. Shadow Mode enables pilot testing—AI processes and classifies documents, but all items require human confirmation during the validation period. A feedback loop captures staff corrections to continuously improve model accuracy over time.

---

### 2.7 Integration Architecture

Blair integrates with your existing systems: **SRFax** for fax reception and transmission, **Cerebrum EMR** for patient matching and document routing, **Salesforce** for physician directory data, **Zendesk** for support ticket escalation, and **Slack** for real-time team notifications. Each integration has a dedicated monitoring page for visibility into sync status and error handling.

📄 [See PRD Section 6: Integration Architecture](https://github.com/Optimal-Research-Team/blair/blob/main/docs/BLAIR_PRD.md#6-integration-architecture)

---

### 2.8 Canadian Data Residency and Healthcare Experience

Blair is designed specifically for Canadian specialty clinics with built-in support for Ontario health cards (OHIP), Canadian physician identifiers (CPSO numbers), and provincial health number fields. The system architecture supports Canadian data residency requirements with infrastructure deployed in Canadian regions.

📄 [See PRD Section 8: RFP Requirements Fulfillment](https://github.com/Optimal-Research-Team/blair/blob/main/docs/BLAIR_PRD.md#8-rfp-requirements-fulfillment)

---

### 2.9 Pilot-First Path for Validation

Shadow Mode provides a safe pilot path for accuracy validation. During pilot, AI processes all documents but none are auto-filed—staff review every item while the system learns from corrections. Performance dashboards track auto-file accuracy, staff override rates, and processing time improvements, providing data to confidently transition to production mode.

📄 [See PRD Section 5.8.1: Auto-File Settings (Shadow Mode)](https://github.com/Optimal-Research-Team/blair/blob/main/docs/BLAIR_PRD.md#581-auto-file-settings-settingsauto-file)

---

### 2.10 Outbound Communication Module

The Compose slide-over enables staff to request missing items via fax, email, or AI-powered phone calls. Template-based messaging auto-populates patient details and missing item lists. Follow-up reminders can be scheduled automatically, and AI voice agents can place calls to referring offices, providing transcripts of conversations for audit trails.
